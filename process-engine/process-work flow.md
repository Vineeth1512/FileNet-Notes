# 🏦 Loan Approval: Process vs Workflow

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ Process (Big Picture)

A **process** means the **overall goal** and all activities needed to complete it.  
It shows **what** happens — from start to end.

### **Loan Approval Process**
1. Customer applies for a loan  
2. Bank verifies documents  
3. Credit team checks credit score  
4. Manager approves or rejects  
5. Customer gets the result (approved/rejected)

✅ **This is the process** — it tells what steps are needed to approve a loan.

## 🔄 2️⃣ Workflow (Step-by-Step Path)

A **workflow** shows **how** the process moves between people or systems.  
It focuses on **who does what**, **in what order**, and **how information moves**.

### **Loan Approval Workflow**
1. Customer fills out online loan form 🧑‍💻  
   ⬇️  
2. System automatically sends application to document verification team 🧾  
   ⬇️  
3. If documents are valid, workflow routes to credit officer 💼  
   ⬇️  
4. Credit officer checks credit score and adds comments  
   ⬇️  
5. Manager gets notification → reviews → approves/rejects ✅❌  
   ⬇️  
6. System sends an automated email/SMS to customer 📩  

✅ **This is the workflow** — it tells **how the loan process actually flows** between people and systems.
