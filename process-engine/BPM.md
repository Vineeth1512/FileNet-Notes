# 🧠 What is BPM in FileNet?
 
**BPM** means **Business Process Management**.  
It helps companies **automate and manage their daily work** — like approving forms, checking documents, or sending notifications.
 
In **FileNet**, BPM is a part that helps you:
- Create a **workflow** (step-by-step work path)  
- Assign work to people automatically  
- Track who did what and when

## 💡 Example (Easy to Understand)
 
Let’s say your company gets **loan applications**.
 
### Without BPM:
- One person checks documents manually  
- Sends email to another person  
- Then someone else approves  
This takes time and can cause confusion.
 
### With FileNet BPM:
1. You upload a loan application.  
2. FileNet **automatically sends** it to the document checker.  
3. After checking, it **automatically routes** to the manager for approval.  
4. Once approved, it **sends a message** to the customer.  
 
Everything happens **automatically in order** — that’s BPM.
