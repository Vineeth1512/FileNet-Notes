# ✅ Process Designer — Notes

## 📌 What is Process Designer?

Process Designer is a visual tool used to design, model, and automate business workflows.  
It allows business users and developers to create process flows using **drag-and-drop activities** instead of coding everything manually.

### 🔹 In Simple Words:
👉 It is the place where you **draw** how a business process will work step-by-step.

Example (Loan Approval Process Flow):  
Start → Application Check → Document Verification → Credit Check → Approval/Reject → End
