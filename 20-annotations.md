# 📝 FileNet – Annotations

**Annotations** in FileNet allow users to **add comments, notes, or supplementary content** to a document **without changing the original content**.  
They are important for **collaboration, review, and audit purposes**.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Definition
- An **Annotation** is a separate object linked to a document that stores additional information.  
- Types of annotations:
  1. **Text Annotation** – Simple text notes.  
  2. **Image / Multimedia Annotation** – Pictures, diagrams, or attachments.  
  3. **Embedded / Linked Document** – Another document linked as an annotation.  

- Key Points:
  - Annotations **do not modify the original document**.  
  - They are **versioned independently**.  
  - Can be restricted by **security permissions**.
