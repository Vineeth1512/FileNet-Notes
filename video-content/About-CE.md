# 📘 FileNet Content Engine (CE)

## 1️⃣ WHAT is Content Engine?
Content Engine is the **document management system** of FileNet.  
It stores, organizes, secures, and retrieves documents for the organization.

You can call it:  
**“Digital cupboard + Library + Security guard for documents.”**

## 2️⃣ PURPOSE (Why we use Content Engine)

- To store lakhs of documents safely  
- To search documents fast  
- To maintain versions  
- To apply security (who can view/edit)  
- To store metadata (document info)  
- To integrate documents with workflows  

Companies use CE because normal file systems cannot handle huge enterprise-level documents.

## 3️⃣ HOW it works (Simple flow)

1. User uploads a document  
2. CE stores the document as an object  
3. CE saves metadata (name, customer ID, date, etc.)  
4. Security rules are applied  
5. You can search, update, version or view anytime

## 📌 Real-Time Example  
### **Bank KYC Process**
When a customer visits the bank to open an account, they submit documents like Aadhar, PAN, and photos.  
The bank employee scans and uploads these documents into FileNet.

Content Engine:
- Stores them safely  
- Adds metadata like customer ID and upload date  
- Applies security so only authorized employees can view them  

Later, if any team wants to verify the customer’s details, they search using customer ID, and CE quickly retrieves the right documents.
