# 💻 FileNet – Content Engine APIs

**Content Engine (CE) APIs** are the **programmatic interface** to interact with FileNet’s Content Engine.  
They allow developers to **create, fetch, update, delete, and search objects** in the Object Store.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Definition
- **Content Engine APIs** = Libraries (Java, .NET) to interact with **FileNet Content Engine**.  
- Main functionalities:
  1. **Connect** to Content Engine.  
  2. **Fetch** existing objects (Documents, Folders, Custom Objects).  
  3. **Create/Update/Delete** objects.  
  4. **Search and query** objects.  
  5. Handle **versioning, annotations, events, and security**.

**Key Java Classes:**
- `Connection` → Connects to Content Engine.  
- `UserContext` → Authenticates users.  
- `Domain` → Represents the domain.  
- `ObjectStore` → Access the Object Store.  
- `Factory` → Creates instances of Documents, Folders, Custom Objects.  
- `SearchSQL` / `SearchScope` → Execute queries.  
- `RepositoryRowSet` / `IndependentObjectSet` → Hold fetched objects.

## 🗣️ Simple English Definition
Content Engine APIs are like **the bridge between your code and FileNet repository**.  
- You can create, read, update, or delete documents programmatically.  
- You can perform searches, manage versions, handle annotations, and enforce security using code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Automate **document management operations**.  
- Integrate FileNet with **external applications**.  
- Enable **bulk operations** efficiently.  
- Implement **custom business logic and workflows**.

## 🔁 Why We Use CE APIs
- ACCE is suitable for **manual tasks**.  
- CE APIs are essential for **automation, integration, and complex operations**.  
- Allows developers to implement **business rules programmatically**.

## ⚙️ Common Java CE API Modules

| Class / Module | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Connection | Connect to Content Engine |
| UserContext | Authenticate and set security context |
| Domain | Access domain |
| ObjectStore | Access Object Store |
| Factory.Document | Create document instances |
| Factory.Folder | Create folder instances |
| Factory.CustomObject | Create custom object instances |
| SearchSQL / SearchScope | Execute queries on Object Store |
| RepositoryRowSet | Store results of queries |
| IndependentObjectSet | Store fetched objects |

## 💡 Real-Time Analogy
- Think of **ACCE as the GUI** for FileNet.  
- **Content Engine APIs** = Your **remote control / programming interface**.  
- You can **automate repetitive tasks**, integrate with other software, and perform bulk updates efficiently.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario
- **Automated Metadata Update**: After a system migration, update thousands of documents’ properties automatically.  
- **Bulk Archival**: Move all documents older than 5 years to an archive folder programmatically.  
- **Workflow Trigger**: Start a workflow automatically when a document is created in a specific folder.
